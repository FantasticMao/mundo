Mundo is a tiny and out-of-the-box (also maybe useless) component for business programming. It
provides some common business implementation and programming conventions for
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) applications. Its main content comes from some
personal requirements that I meet in my daily study and work, so you probably don't need it.

## Features

### mundo-core

- [x] `cn.fantasticmao.mundo.core.util.*` provides some common util classes

### mundo-data

- [x] `AbstractDomain` defines common attributes in Domain types
- [x] `@RoutingSeed` and `RoutingDataSource` supports route strategy on datasource level
- [x] `IdGenerator` provides the implementation of the distributed ID algorithm

### mundo-web
